    <h2>Details on Terminology</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>1. Data</dt>
            <dd>Data are the raw bits and pieces of information with no context. Values like “15, 23, 14, 85,” are raw facts termed as data.Data can be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data is numeric, the result of a measurement, count, or some other mathematical calculation. Qualitative data is descriptive. “Ruby Red,” the color of a 2013 Ford Focus, is an example of qualitative data. A number can be qualitative too: if I tell you my favorite number is 5, that is qualitative data because it is descriptive, not the result of a measurement or mathematical calculation. Data are the value stored in database</dd>
            <DT>2. Information</DT>
            <dd>Information are processed data which gives meaningful information us.Information is the data that has been converted into more useful or intelligent form. Information in the context of computers refers to processed data that has meaning and relevance to users. It is a fundamental concept in computing and is crucial for various tasks ranging from simple calculations to complex data analysis and decision-making.</dd>
            <dt>3. Meta Data</dt>
            <dd>Metadata refers to data that provides information about other data. It offers context, meaning, and attributes that help describe, organize, and manage different types of information. In the realm of computing and information systems, metadata plays a crucial role in enhancing the understanding, accessibility, and usability of data.</dd>

            <dt>4. Data Dictionary</dt>
            <dd>A Data Dictionary is a collection of names, definitions, and attributes about data elements that are being used or captured in a database, information system, or part of a research project. It is a centralized repository of metadata that provides a detailed description of data elements within a database or information system. It serves as a comprehensive reference guide that defines the structure, format, semantics, and relationships of data elements and entities.  It describes the meanings and purposes of data elements within the context of a project, and provides guidance on interpretation, accepted meanings and representation. </dd>

            <dt>5. Database</dt>
            <dd>Database, any collection of data, or information, that is specially organized for rapid search and retrieval by a computer. Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with various data-processing operations. </dd>

            <dt>6. Table</dt>
            <dd>Table refers to detailed information about the structure, contents, and characteristics of a specific table within the database schema. Tables are fundamental components of relational databases, organizing data into rows (records) and columns (fields).</dd>
            <p>Table name and purpose</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Name</li>
                The unique identifier of the table within the database schema.
                <li>Purpose</li>
                A brief description or summary of the purpose of the table, explaining what kind of data it stores and its intended use.
            </ul>

            <dt>7. Tuple(s)</dt>
            <dd>A tuple, also known as a record or row, is a basic unit of data in a relational database management system (DBMS). A tuple represents a single instance of a relation, or table, in the database. Each tuple contains a set of values, or attributes, that correspond to the columns, or fields, of the relation. It refers to the single row of data within a table. </dd>

            <dt>8. Field(s)</dt>
            <dd>Fields refer to a specific piece of data within a table that represents an attribute or characteristics of entities ("rows") stored in that table. Fields are further organized into columns, and each field corresponds to a single data type.</dd>

            <dt>9. Domain(s)</dt>
            <dd>Domain refers to the set of possible values that a column or attribute in a table can hold. It defines the allowable range of values, data types like (int,varchar,bigint,date,boolean,etc), and constraints that apply to a specific attribute within a database. It has characteristics like data format, default values, constraints and validations,etc.</dd>

            <dt>10. Constraint(s)</dt>
            <dd>Constraints in a database refer to rules and conditions that enforce data integrity, accuracy, and consistency within tables. They ensure that data meets specific criteria or conditions, preventing invalid data from being inserted or updated. Constraints are essential for maintaining data quality and enforcing business rules. It serve as a set of predefined rules that govern the behavior and relationships of the data in a database, helping to maintain its accuracy and reliability.</dd>
            <dt>11. Key(s)</dt>
            <dd>A key refers to an attribute/a set of attributes that help us identify a row (or tuple) uniquely in a table (or relation). A key is also used when we want to establish relationships between the different columns and tables of a relational database.</dd>
            <p>The different types of keys used in daabase system are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary key</li>
                <li>Super key</li>
                <Li>Candidate key</Li>
                <li>Foreign key</li>
                <li>Composite key</li>
                <li>Unique key</li>
                <li>Alternate key</li>
            </ul>
